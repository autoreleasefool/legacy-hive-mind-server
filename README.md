# HiveAI Server

Backend access to the HiveMind.

## Getting started

1. First, you'll need to grab a couple other repos to build the entire system and play a game of Hive against the HiveMind.
    * [Hive Client](https://github.com/josephroquedev/hive-client)
    * [Hive Server](https://github.com/josephroquedev/hive-server)
    * [HiveMind](https://github.com/josephroquedev/hivemind)
2. 
2. `bundle install` to install dependencies, including [Ruby on Rails](https://github.com/rails/rails/)
3. `rails s` to start the server
    * You may need to update `app/controllers/hive_mind_controller.rb` to point to your clone of [HiveMind](https://github.com/josephroquedev/hivemind)
    * Currently, the app assumes the two repositories have been cloned within the same parent directory
4. That's it! You've got a server running.

### Requirements

* Swift 4.1+
* [Vapor](https://vapor.codes)

## Contributing

1. Install SwiftLint for styling conformance:
    * `brew install swiftlint`
    * Run `swiftlint` from the root of the repository.
    * There should be no errors or violations. If there are, please fix them before opening a PR.
2. Open a PR with your changes üëç
